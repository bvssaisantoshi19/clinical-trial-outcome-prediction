## üìÑ Short Overview
This repository presents an **end-to-end machine learning workflow** to predict whether a **clinical trial** is likely to **succeed or fail**, based on its *design characteristics* (phase, intervention type, allocation, masking, model, purpose, sponsor type, eligibility, enrollment, duration, etc.).

Built from the **AACT (ClinicalTrials.gov)** open registry, the project includes:
- Complete **data pipeline** ‚Äî extraction, cleaning, merging, feature engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äî univariate, bivariate, and multivariate insights     
- **Modeling** ‚Äî Logistic Regression & XGBoost with **Youden‚Äôs J** thresholds  
- **Interpretability** ‚Äî SHAP (global + local)  
- **Deployment** ‚Äî Streamlit app for real-time design feasibility prediction

> This work bridges **clinical research design** and **data science**, demonstrating how data-driven insights can guide early-phase feasibility assessments.

## üìò Project Overview  

Clinical trials often fail due to design inefficiencies, under-enrollment, or unrealistic expectations of intervention success.  
This project aims to **predict the likelihood of trial completion (Success vs Failure)** by analyzing historical trial designs from the **AACT (ClinicalTrials.gov)** database.

### üéØ Objectives  
- Identify which **design parameters** most influence trial success or failure.  
- Build an interpretable **machine-learning pipeline** to forecast trial outcomes.  
- Create a **Streamlit web app** for real-time prediction and feasibility validation.  
- Enable early detection of potentially **high-risk trial designs** before execution.  

### üß± Key Features  
- End-to-end reproducible pipeline: from raw AACT tables to deployment  
- Dual modeling approach: **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** with Youden‚Äôs J thresholds  
- Integrated **clinical validity checker** to flag impossible design combinations  
- Full **SHAP interpretability** for transparent model explanations  
- Lightweight **Streamlit interface** for research and educational use

## üß© Data Pipeline (Summary)
**Sources:** AACT (Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov) ‚Äî standardized data for >430k trials.  
**Core tables:** `studies`, `interventions`, `conditions`, `eligibilities`, `sponsors`, `designs` were extracted using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy

### Cleaning & Transformations (high level)
- Standardized missing values; log-scaled `enrollment` & `duration`.
- Reassigned hybrid phases (e.g., *Phase 1/2*, *Phase 2/3*) using enrollment distribution logic.
- Grouped granular conditions/interventions into broader categories.
- Encoded trial design features (allocation, masking, model, purpose)  
- Added binary trial-level flags (`has_dmc`, `is_fda_regulated_drug`, `healthy_volunteers`, etc.)
- Simplified sponsor types; removed `sponsor_role` (dominantly ‚Äúlead‚Äù).

### Merging & Outputs
- Tables merged on `nct_id` ‚Üí `df_merged.csv` ‚Üí (EDA) ‚Üí final model-ready datasets:
  - **One-hot version** for Logistic Regression
  - **Grouped-categorical version** for XGBoost

### Storage Notes
- **Large/full datasets are stored locally** (to avoid GitHub size limits).  
- **Sample / downsampled** processed files are included in the repo for illustration and to ensure code runs.

### Folder mapping
- `/data/processed/` ‚Äì cleaned and merged (sample) datasets
- `/data/final/` ‚Äì model ready datasets (one-hot and grouped versions)
- `/results/` ‚Äì EDA plots, statistical outputs, model metrics, SHAP visuals  
- `/models/` ‚Äì serialized pipelines & feature lists  
- `/app/` ‚Äì Streamlit deployment

## ü§ñ Modeling & Evaluation (Summary)
Two supervised machine learning models were developed to predict **clinical trial success (1)** or **failure (0)**:

- **Logistic Regression** (one-hot features) ‚Äî interpretable baseline  
- **XGBoost** (grouped features) ‚Äî stronger non-linear performance

### Features used
- **Categorical:** `Phase`, `Intervention Type`, `Condition`, `Allocation`, `Masking`, `Model`, `Purpose`, `Sponsor`  
- **Numerical:** `log_enrollment`, `log_duration`, `number_of_arms`, `intervention_count`  
- **Binary Flags:** `has_dmc`, `is_fda_regulated_drug`, `healthy_volunteers`, `has_expanded_access`, `is_fda_regulated_device`.

### Training
1. **Data Split:** 80% training / 20% testing (stratified by success/failure outcome).  
2. **Model Configuration:**  
   - Multiple parameter sets were **experimentally compared** in earlier notebooks to identify stable, well-performing configurations.  
   - Final models used:
     - Logistic Regression ‚Üí `solver = "lbfgs"`, `C = 1`, `penalty = "l2"`  
     - XGBoost ‚Üí `n_estimators = 200`, `max_depth = 8`, `scale_pos_weight = 1`
3. **Threshold Optimization:**  
   - The **Youden‚Äôs J Index** (*Sensitivity + Specificity ‚àí 1*) was used to determine optimal cutoffs:  
     - Logistic Regression ‚âà **0.42**  
     - XGBoost ‚âà **0.85**  
   - These thresholds were later used in both the evaluation and Streamlit app deployment.

### Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- PR curves to validate threshold choice

### Model Interpretability (SHAP Analysis)
- **Global:** Ranked features by average SHAP value to identify strong predictors (e.g., `log_enrollment`, `log_duration`, `phase`, `sponsor`, `model`, `intervention_type`). 
- **Local:** Force/waterfall plots explain individual predictions.

This dual-level explainability made the models both **transparent and scientifically interpretable**.

### Artifacts
- `/models/` ‚Äì `logreg_pipeline.pkl`, `xgb_pipeline.pkl`, `X_cols_logreg.pkl`, `X_cols_xgb.pkl`  
- `/results/` ‚Äì metrics, curves, SHAP plots

## üåê Streamlit App (Deployment Summary)
A Streamlit web application was built to make the model results interactive and interpretable.  
It integrates both **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** models with their **Youden‚Äôs J thresholds**
(LogReg ‚âà 0.42, XGBoost ‚âà 0.85).

### Highlights
- **Interactive design input:** Users can select trial parameters such as phase, intervention type, conditions, allocation, masking, sponsor etc.  
- **Automatic validity checks:** Flags logically invalid configurations (e.g., randomized single-group trials).  
- **Model interpretation section:** Explains threshold rationale, limitations, and ethical disclaimer in a collapsible block.

**Run locally**
```bash
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```

*All supporting files (app.py, requirements.txt, README_app.txt, and model artifacts) are located in the /app directory.*
*Full app details live in /app/README_app.txt.*

## üìä Results & Key Insights (Summary)
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses revealed clear design-level patterns in clinical trial outcomes.  
- Higher completion rates: Phase 3, randomized, parallel, double-masked, often industry-sponsored.
- Lower completion rates: open-label single-group.  
- Behavioral interventions showed higher than expected completion rates. 
- **Logistic Regression** offered interpretability and transparent coefficients, serving as a robust statistical baseline.  
- **XGBoost** achieved better recall and overall balance, identifying more realistic design patterns linked to successful outcomes.
- Youden thresholds improved failure detection
- The combination of both provided a complete perspective ‚Äî **explainability** from Logistic Regression and **predictive strength** from XGBoost.
